6. Fetch the home_points and away_points from the results table using the game_id in the user_bets table
7. Fetch the home_line,home team,away line, away team from the game table using the game_id in the user bets table
8. Match the team in the user_bets column to the home team. If there is a match, team is home_team. If no match, team is away_team
9.Find the value of (home_points - away_points). Call this difference. 
For straight up:
1. If the difference is greater than 0, set home_team_victorious to True. If this value is true,
if team in the user_bet table = home_team, winner=user_id. If home_team_victorius = False, if team in the user_bet table is not home_team, winner=user_id
Else, winner=friend_id
For point spread:
1. If the difference is greater than the away_line, set home_team_victorious to True. If this value is true,
if team in the user_bet table = home_team, winner=user_id. If home_team_victorius = False, if team in the user_bet table is not home_team, winner=user_id
Else, winner=friend_id
